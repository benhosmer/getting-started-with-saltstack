# Interacting with the Community

It is likely that you will encounter issues, bugs, and problems as you use SALT and all of its tools.

With that being said, don't be scared off from using SALT.

This is normal with all software projects, but SALT has the benefit of a helpful and vibrant community.

One of the greatest aspects of SALT is that it is open source. This means a great deal to you, even if you may not realize it yet.

Being open source means that you can inspect the source code, improve it, and you are highly encouraged to contribute those changes back to the project.

Often these changes will be merged back into the project within minutes or hours.

There is a a company behind SALT, SALTSTACK Inc., but there are no intentions to make the project closed-source or to offer a crippled community edition, and an expensive more feature-rich paid version.

I've had a few discussions with Thomas Hatch, the original author and copyright holder of SALTSTACK about this. He informed me that the enterprise editions will include support as well as much more rigorously tested code. It might also be a few months behind the open source version. This appeals to enterprise customers, but he has made it clear that he does not intend to wall SALT off so to speak from the community version.

You can be safe that your cognitive, and infrastructure investment won't be left with an outdated or unsupported product.

SALTSTACK is licensed under the Apache License, which means that  you could always copy it, change the name, and create a new project based off of it.

This is software freedom which empowers you, the user, the most.

Being open source also means that there are many contributors evaluating and using SALT. Most users, like me, are not employed by SALTSTACK Inc., and receive no monetary compensation from them at all. This keeps the software fresh and allows anyone to contribute new ideas back. This also provides the benefit of quick bug fixes and better testing, since every user is able to troubleshoot and find problems, and might encounter use cases that someone else hasn't.

I urge you to find a way to contribute back to the project.

If you're a developer with a fairly basic understanding of Python, the entire [SALTSTACK](http://github.com/saltstack/salt) project is hosted publicly on [github](http://github.com). Pull requests are always welcome and you'll find many developers, employees of SALTSTACK Inc., or just users, ready to help you.

If you aren't a coder, you can still contribute back to the project.

Finding and fixing documentation issues is one way. Writing blog posts about topics that you found difficult is another. You can also help by testing new releases and reporting back and issues you find.

You'll probably come up with even more ways than those if you've been involved with open source for any length of time.


## Getting Help

As much as I've tried to make this text clear and understandable, inevitably you will find something confusing.

You'll find the power of the SALTSTACK community within your reach when this does happen. Often, you'll find your question answered within minutes. Bug fixes will be incorporated within hours sometimes.

### The Mailing List

Currently the [SALTSTACK Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/salt-users) is hosted with [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com). All you need is a google account and you post and answer questions on the list. This is a great resource and it is all archived. This should be your first stop if you think you've found a bug, or something isn't quite clear. Chances are, if it is confusing for you, it probably was confusing for someone else too. It is a fairly active list, with about twenty-five posts per day right now.

### IRC or Internet Relay Chat

You can find the [`#SALT`](http://webchat.freenode.net/) channel hosted by [freenode](http://freenode.net/). If you've never used irc before, you can find a great guide hosted by the [Drupal](https://drupal.org/irc/setting-up) Project. This gives a general overview of installing and using irc. 

IRC is like a chat-room where you can realtime feedback and interact with other SALT community members. 

Don't ask to ask a question, simply just ask your question and chances are within minutes you will get an answer.

This is also a great place to just hang out and watch other questions come in as well. 

Don't be shy, just jump in!

### Training

SALTSTACK Inc. offers [paid training](http://saltstack.com/services) as well. This is a great way to learn SALT in-depth from the creators. 

Often you'll find two or three hour courses offered for free at many open source conferences though.
