# Credits

I'd like to recognize those that have contributed knowledge, proof-reading, or
devoted their own time to helping me with this book.

If I only had a user name, I notate here. If the user provided me a full name
and gave permission to use it, I also notate it here.

These are my crowd-sourced editors and they took the time to point out mistakes, 
and help make this book better.

If we ever meet in person, I would like to thank you and buy you your beverage
of choice!
