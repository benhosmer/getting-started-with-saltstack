# Foreward

This book began as a paid contract for a publishing company. I was writing it in my sparetime, but the publisher and I had different opinions about where the book was going.

It sat on my hard drive after we went our separate ways for almost a year until I got around to updating it and self-publishing it myself.

In the spirit of Open Source I decided to offer it at no cost, with the option to purchase it as well and release it under a Creative Commons License.

Honestly, I'm staggered and humbled by the number of people who have actually _paid_ not only the suggested price of the book, but often chose to pay _more_. I've also been contacted by readers thanking me and telling me that they have found this book useful and helpful. This was the entire goal of the project - share and provide information to others.

If you notice any typos and want to submit errata, I welcome it. You can use the discussion mechanism where you purchased it, or the issue pages since the entire text is hosted at [Github](https://github.com/benhosmer/getting-started-with-saltstack). You can also contact me directly by email. I'm pretty easy find on Google + and Twitter @bhosmer.
